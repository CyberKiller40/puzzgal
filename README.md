# PuzzGal
a static jigsaw puzzle gallery creator

This is a commandline tool with a purpose of taking a directory of images (jigsaw puzzle images) and specific YAML formatted config files, and based on that generate a set of miniatures and a static html webpage with those miniatures, linked to full images, and ready to use bbcode snippets to post on web forums. All with not changing the filenames or directory structure, only static files are created, which will allow to use very basic and cheap hosting options.

Developed in Python, with an aim of not relying on external applications (only Python libraries).
